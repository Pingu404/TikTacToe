# TikTacToe
TikTacToe Game for Java

This is my TikTacToe game I made for Java! 
It was a fun project. I got board and included 2 bots, an easy and a hard bot (they are both pretty easy to beat). You an always win on the easy bot if you go a1 a2 a3.
The other bot is a bit harder, but not to much harder. 

I also relised I made the game using varubles insted of an array, so i fixed that. I was begining to run out of names for the scripts so the one with the actual code is called Gorm. I dont know why I called it that.
There is the scipt that is called arrayGame, or something simmiler. Dont use that one, it is not good, I kept it becase I wanted some way to show my thinking while I was codeing, I also might add more later?!

HAVE FUN!!!
